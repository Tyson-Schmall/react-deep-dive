# Skeleton React starter Project

> Provided for the students of the [Bottega Code School](https://bottega.tech/)

This program was just to demonstrate how to make use of state and props in react.

It is a framework for reference in the future if I need it or ever get stuck trying to build or debug in react with these specific features in mind.
